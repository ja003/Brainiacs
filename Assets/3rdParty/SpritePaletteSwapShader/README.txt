** Sprite Palette Swap Shader **

Sprite Palette Swap is a shader designed to replace colors from sprites textures based on its palettes colors.
Save both computer memory and development time: one Sprite can have multiple color variations during gameplay.
Using this shader you can swap a palette color by another one very easily.
This technique is very common in the game development industry even today.
The shader is based on the default unity Sprite shader, with all its settings available. 
If your 2D game interacts with light, there is a variant of this shader based on the Unity Diffuse Sprite shader as well.

You can read the official setup process on Sprite Palette Swap Shader pdf file.
Please see the Sample Scene available on Assets/Scenes folder.
